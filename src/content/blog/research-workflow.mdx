Over the years, I have refined my research workflow to maximize productivity while maintaining reproducibility. Here is an overview of the tools and processes I rely on.

## Paper Reading

I use a combination of Semantic Scholar alerts and Twitter/X lists to stay up to date with the latest research. For each paper I read, I take structured notes with three sections:

- **Summary**: One-paragraph overview
- **Key contributions**: Bulleted list
- **Relevance to my work**: How it connects to current projects

## Experiment Management

All experiments are tracked using Weights & Biases. Every run includes:

- Hyperparameter configuration
- Training curves and metrics
- Model checkpoints
- Random seeds for reproducibility

## Writing

I write papers in LaTeX using Overleaf for collaboration. My typical writing process:

1. Outline with bullet points
2. First draft focusing on figures and results
3. Iteration with co-authors
4. Final polish and submission

## Conclusion

Having a consistent workflow reduces cognitive overhead and lets me focus on the research itself rather than the logistics of doing research.
