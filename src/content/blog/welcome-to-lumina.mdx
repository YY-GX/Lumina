Welcome to **Lumina**, a next-generation academic portfolio template built with Astro. This post explores the key features that make Lumina perfect for researchers and academics.

## Why Lumina?

Traditional academic websites are either too complex to set up or too basic in design. Lumina strikes the perfect balance:

- **5-minute setup** for a basic "business card" site
- **Apple-level polish** with glassmorphic design and smooth animations
- **Zero JavaScript** shipped by default — everything is static HTML and CSS
- **BibTeX-driven** publications — just drop in your `.bib` file

## Getting Started

Edit `site.config.yml` to set your name, bio, and social links. Toggle pages on and off with simple boolean flags. Add your publications by placing a BibTeX file in `src/content/publications/`.

## Features

Lumina supports over 15 page types:

- Publications with venue badges and search
- CV rendered from YAML
- Project portfolio with bento grid
- Blog with MDX support
- Photo gallery, bookshelf, and more

## Code Example

Here is a simple Python function:

```python
def hello_lumina():
    print("Welcome to Lumina!")
    return True
```

All code blocks are syntax-highlighted using Shiki with theme-aware colors.
