I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Greendale University, where I lead the **Language, Learning & Fairness Lab (LLF Lab)**. My research sits at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and AI ethics.

## Research Interests

- **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: Developing methods for transferring knowledge across tasks and domains with minimal computational overhead.
- **Low-Resource NLP**: Building robust language technologies that work for underserved languages and communities.
- **AI Fairness**: Creating machine learning systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.

## Background

Before joining Greendale, I completed my PhD at MIT. I received my BS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, graduating with highest honors. I have published 40+ papers at top venues including ICML, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP, and AAAI.
