### Why Lumina?

- **One config file.** Your entire site — profile, social links, pages, theme — lives in `site.config.yml`.
- **BibTeX-native.** Drop your `papers.bib` and get a beautiful, searchable publications page with venue badges, links, and author highlighting — automatically.
- **10 themes × 5 palettes = 50+ looks.** Switch with one line. Every combination supports dark mode.
- **18 pages ready to go.** Publications, CV, Blog, Projects, Teaching, News, Team, Gallery, Talks, and more. Toggle each on/off.
- **Blazing fast.** Static HTML. Zero JavaScript frameworks on the client. Perfect Lighthouse scores.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YY-GX/Lumina.git my-site
cd my-site
npm install
```

Edit `site.config.yml` with your info, then:

```bash
npm run dev       # Preview at localhost:4321
